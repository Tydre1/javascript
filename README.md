# JavaScript Things ðŸš€

Here we have arrays, variables and objects. I participated of a course of Alura and this was their class. They taught us all this things and we had to learn everything.

# Did I memorized everything? ðŸ˜…

Actually not everything, but i think that if i practice and do some jobs for myself i can decorate almost everything. So its good for me archive those things here for not forget.
